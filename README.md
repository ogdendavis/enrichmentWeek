# Learning to Code with JavaScript

This is a template for a week-long series of lessons for an 8th grade Enrichment
class. Students will open the HTML document in their browser, and will use the
console to learn and practice basic coding concepts with JavaScript.

A general overview of the lessons:

## Day 1
Students will learn to view source, select an HTML element, and read the basic
attributes of that element. They will be able to make changes to an element in
the inspector.

* Have students open starter file in their browser
* Demonstrate opening the inspector, and using the mouse selection tool
* Explain class and id attributes
* Have students identify which row and col cells are in using attributes
* Demonstrate adding style attribute with background color
* Have students draw a smiley face or similar by adding bg color to cells

## Day 2
Students will learn to select an element by ID with JavaScript and output
information about that element to the console.

## Day 3
Students will learn to change inline style using the inspector, and to change
styles using JavaScript.

## Day 4
Students will learn to select multiple items by class name in JavaScript, and
to apply or remove classes from elements using JavaScript.

# Day 5
Students will use their skills, and a provided list of pre-made css classes,
to create an original piece of art using the template grid.
