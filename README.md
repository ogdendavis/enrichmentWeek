# Learning to Code with JavaScript

This is a template for a week-long series of lessons for an 8th grade Enrichment
class. Students will open the HTML document in their browser, and will use the
console to learn and practice basic coding concepts with JavaScript.

A general overview of the lessons:

## Day 1
Students will learn to view source, select an HTML element, and read the basic
attributes of that element. They will be able to make changes to an element in
the inspector.

* Have students open starter file in their browser
* Demonstrate opening the inspector, and using the mouse selection tool
* Explain class and id attributes
* Have students identify which row and col cells are in using attributes
* Demonstrate adding style attribute with background color
* Have students draw a smiley face or similar by adding bg color to cells

## Day 2
Students will learn to select an element by ID with JavaScript and output
information about that element to the console. Students will learn to add or
change inline styles using JavaScript.

* Refresher on grid using classes and ids
* What is a variable? Demonstrate in browser's JavaScript console
* Demonstrate selecting element with getElementById
* Demonstrate selecting element with querySelector (warn about multiples)
* Demonstrate changing or adding inline style via the console
* Have students recreate yesterday's drawing using JavaScript
  * Students will copy/paste their code into a Google Doc
  * Students will save this Doc for use throughout the week

Example code in day2.js

## Day 3
Students will learn to use variables to remember data and make changes more
easily.

## Day 4
Students will learn to select multiple items by class name in JavaScript, and
to apply or remove classes from elements using JavaScript.

# Day 5
Students will use their skills, and a provided list of pre-made css classes,
to create an original piece of art using the template grid.
